## Load Example Names into DynamoDB

This simple script will load a list of fictitious names into a DynamoDB table for use with the Card Swipe API. To get started, make sure the values at the top of `load.py` match what's in your environment - specifically around the region and name of the DyamoDB table you wish to load the data into. Once confirmed, simply run:

```
./load.py
```

and that's it!
